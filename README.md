# Free Mobile Apps Analysis
Guided Project: Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets <br/> <br/>

Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users. This means our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use our app â€” the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better.  <br/><br/>

The main purpose for me (developer) is to improve my Python and Data Analysis skills and also use this project to start my portifolio. <br/> <br/>

This project is based on DataQuest course: Python for Data Science: Fundamentals <br/>
