# Mobile_Apps_Analysis
Free Mobile Apps Analysis Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users. This means our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use our app â€” the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better.  <br/><br/>
The purpose for me is to practice some Python skills and use this project to start my portifolio. <br/> <br/>
This project is based on DataQuest course: Python for Data Science: Fundamentals </br>
